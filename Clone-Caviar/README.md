# Clone Caviar

This is a benchmark module meant to help you practice your HTML & CSS skills and combine them with some basic browser-side JS to produce a semi-functional clone of a [restaurant page on the Caviar website](https://www.trycaviar.com/sf-east-bay/homeroom-151).

Don't be discouraged if this takes you some time to complete - it will take effort, but getting to a finished product will be worth it.

Re-create a page from Caviar by following the designs of the screenshots in the [mockups](./mockups) subdirectory. Write your code to the [specifications](#specifications) using the files in the [scaffold](./scaffold) subdirectory.

You **should not** use real data - just use placeholder text and images from the [scaffold/data.txt](./scaffold/data.txt) file for the header content and items' titles, images, and description.

## Specifications

- Your `index.html` page matches the design of the images in the [mockups](./mockups) subdirectory: [mockups/caviar-homeroom.png](./mockups/caviar-homeroom.png) and [mockups/caviar-footer.png](./mockups/caviar-footer.png) (\*see note below for exceptions)
- Your page has the _exact_ same alignment, spacing, and colors as the mockup images, and uses the "Helvetica Neue" typeface
- Your page uses the same icons as the mockups (provided in the [scaffold/icons](./scaffold/icons) subdirectory)
- Hovering over an item gives it an orange overlay and shows the text "Add to cart" (as shown in [mockups/caviar-homeroom-item-hover.png](./mockups/caviar-homeroom-item-hover.png))
- Clicking on "View Available Hours" opens the hours modal (as shown in [mockups/caviar-hours-modal.png](./mockups/caviar-hours-modal.png))
- Clicking _anywhere_ on an item (i.e. over the image, title, description, and price) opens the item modal (as shown in [mockups/caviar-item-modal.png](./mockups/caviar-item-modal.png)
- Your site is responsive and when the window is made narrower the elements will re-align as shown in [mockups/caviar-narrow-screen.png](./mockups/caviar-narrow-screen.png)

Best practices:

- Code is in a repository on GitHub
- Your progress is preserved by committing often
- Your HTML and CSS is properly formatted with consistent indentation and spacing
- There is no unused code (e.g. HTML elements with classes or IDs that aren't styled in CSS or used by JS)

\* **Exceptions**: You do not need to build any features not listed in these specs. No login, no cart, etc.
